HeartRate (fps monitor for HTML5 canvas demos)

HeartRate is a cute fps calculator and monitor you can 
add to your HTML5 Canvas demos. The idea was taken from 
the wonderful @mrdoob (http://mrdoob.com/) who always 
puts a fancy fps meter on all of his demos. I noticed 
some people started using his meter on their demos too. 
I thought why not make my own and make it easy to add to
other projects.

After showing Tomasz my initial design he offered to
donate 20 mins of his time and quickly modelled a 3d 
rotating heart. I think it looks great. Thanks man!

Using HeartRate is easy, simply add it to the draw loop
you wish to monitor.

  var FPS = 50;

  var heartRate = new HeartRate({{context: ctx, maxFPS: FPS, path: "./heartrate"}); 

  window.setInterval(draw, 1000/FPS);
  
  function draw() {
    heartRate.monitor(10, 10); // renders HeartRate monitor on canvas x, y position

    //..
  }

If you wish you can use HeartRate without canvas to simply calculate fps and frameCount.

  var FPS = 50;

  var heartRate = new HeartRate(); 

  window.setInterval(draw, 1000/FPS);
  
  function draw() {
    heartRate.update(); // renders HeartRate monitor on canvas x, y position
    
    console.log(heartRate.frameRate + " " + heartRate.frameCount);

    //..
  }
